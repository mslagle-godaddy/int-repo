# Interview-App

## Goal
Following your personal best practices & preferences, implement a basic app that will render the dog breed data from the given remote data source into a scrollable list, handling the following scenarios:
- Data is fetched successfully from the data source
  - Render list in alphabetical order by breed name
  - Display images alongside the information
- An error is encountered while fetching the data
  - Allow the user to retry
- Unit test as much as possible.

## Stretch Goals
Once data is rendered, implement a basic search bar that will filter the list based on the user input against the name and description.

## Notes
- The main focus should be on getting the data from the remote source and rendering it to the screen using what you view as the best practices, preferences, and architecture. The UI itself is NOT the focus of this exercise, and you should spend as little time on it as possible.
- You can use any libraries or frameworks you want
- You can use any design patterns you want
- You can change or extend any part of the initial codebase with the exception of the data fetching logic
